### $ About Me
Hi there! My name is Ludvik, and I'm currently studying **Back-End Development**!

In 2024, I earned my **Higher Professional Degree in Network & IT Security**. Starting with minimal knowledge, I built a strong foundation in computers, cybersecurity, network management, and IT systems. It was a great learning experience and sparked my interest to further pursue this field. During the program, we had a Python programming course that I really enjoyed, and for my final exam project, I created a [password manager](https://github.com/luddekn/lock-and-key). This experience is what led me to study Back-End Development, as it piqued my interest during that course.
