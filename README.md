### $ About Me
Hi there! My name is Ludvik, and I'm currently studying **Back-End Development**!

In 2024, I earned my **Higher Professional Degree in Network & IT Security**, where I built a strong foundation in computers, cybersecurity, network management, and IT systems. One of the highlights of my studies was a Python programming course, during which I created a [password manager](https://github.com/luddekn/lock-and-key) as my final exam project. (*Warning, messy source code!*ðŸ˜…)
